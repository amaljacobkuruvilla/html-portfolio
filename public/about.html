<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Amal Jacob Kuruvilla, a passionate Full-Stack Developer from Kerala, India. With a solid foundation in engineering and a keen interest in technology, I transitioned into the world of web development to create impactful digital solutions.</p>

<p>I specialize in building dynamic, user-friendly websites and applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). My journey into full-stack development has been fueled by a curiosity to learn, innovate, and solve real-world problems through code.</p>

<p>Previously, I honed my skills working as an Implementation and Support Associate in the HRMS domain, where I gained valuable insights into client needs and software functionality.</p>

<P>When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring creative solutions to challenges, enjoying the beauty of Kerala, or working on personal development projects.</P>

<P>Feel free to check out my portfolio and connect with me—I’m always excited to collaborate and learn!</P>
